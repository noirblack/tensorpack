+ If you did something specific and it failed, please use the "Unexpected Problems /
  Bugs" category.

+ Your question is probably answered in [tutorials](http://tensorpack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/index.html#user-tutorials). Read it first.

+ We answer "HOW to do X with Tensorpack" for a well-defined X.
  We also answer "HOW/WHY Tensorpack does X" for some X that Tensorpack or its examples are doing.

  We __don't__ answer general machine learning questions, such as "why my training doesn't converge", "what networks to use" or "I don't understand the paper".

You can also use gitter (https://gitter.im/tensorpack/users) for more casual discussions.
